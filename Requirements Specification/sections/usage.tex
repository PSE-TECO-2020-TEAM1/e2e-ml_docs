The application is for collecting and labeling sensor data, training a model from the collected data and serving the stored resulting model to the user to classify actions in real time.

\subsection{Target Groups}
The target group of this application is people that wants to create a machine learning model from mobile sensor Data.
That includes: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item People new to machine learning who wants an easy tool to discover machine learning and create models that they can use.
    \item Experienced engineers that have knowledge of machine learning but need a fast tool to collect data and create a model.
\end{itemize}
We assume a rather technical audience.

\subsection{Operating Conditions} % tarek + enes
The program is a web page that has a mobile version and a desktop version. The program needs a server to train the data and store it. the program can be used from anywhere with a decent network connection to it.
