The application is for collecting and labeling sensor data, training a model from the collected data and serving the stored resulting model to the user to classify actions in real time.

\subsection{Target Groups}
The target audience of this application is people that want to create a machine learning model from mobile sensor data. That includes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Inexperienced people who are new to machine learning and want an easy tool to discover machine learning and create models they can use.
    \item Experienced engineers that have knowledge of machine learning but need a fast tool to collect data and create a model.
\end{itemize}
We assume a rather technical audience who has basic knowledge of how to use a web browser in a desktop and mobile client See \hyperref[Use Cases]{\textbf{Use Cases}} for concrete examples.

\subsection{Operating Conditions}
The tool is a web application that can be run on modern browsers. Specific versions can be found in the operating environment section. A web browser must be installed on the user device to view the webpage.
