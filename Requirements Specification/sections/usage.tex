The application is for collecting and labeling sensor data, training a model from the collected data and serving the stored resulting model to the user to classify actions in real time.

\subsection{Target Groups}
The target group of this application is people that wants to create a machine learning model from mobile sensor Data.
That includes: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item People new to machine learning who wants an easy tool to discover machine learning and create models that they can use.
    \item \textbf{ADD PERSONA TBD}
    \item Experienced engineers that have knowledge of machine learning but need a fast tool to collect data and create a model.
\end{itemize}
We assume a rather technical audience. %(eloborate maybe)

\subsection{Operating Conditions}
The tool is a web application that can be run on any modern browser. A web browser must be installed on the user device to view the webpage. The application can be used from anywhere with a decent network connection.
