\section{Test Cases and Test Scenarios}
\subsection{Test Cases}
Each functionality is tested by at least one of the following test cases. The test cases are divided into two parts to clarify the distinction between main and extending functions. The written test scenarios aim to provide the testers with an structurally definite order of events that will unfold during the ordinary use of application. 
\subsubsection{Main Test Cases}
These test cases are necessary for the web-tool to work properly and succeed in serving
basic requests. Each test case represents a basic action user can take.

\begin{enumerate}[{label = \textbf{/T{\protect\twodigits{\arabic{enumi}}}0/}, leftmargin = *}]
    \item Access web page \hyperref[/F010/]{/F010/}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{/T011/} via Google Chrome,
        \item \textbf{/T012/} via Mozilla Firefox.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Create a new user. 010, 330
    \item Login with existing credentials. 010, 330
    \item Login with invalid credentials. 010, 330
    \item Open an already existing workspace. 020, 040, 060, 340
    \item Create a new workspace. 030
    \item Rename the workspace. 050
    \item Create new label. 070
    \item Rename label. 090
    \item Delete label. 100
    \item Delete sample. 140
    \item Scan QR code for data collection. 110
    \item Scan QR code for classifying data. 
    \item Open the workspace link. 110
    \item Overview collected data. 120
    \item Overview an individual data sample. 130
    \item Overview trained models. 150
    \item Overview an individual model. 160
    \item Check performance metrics of a model. 170
    \item Train and deploy a model. 190
    \item Set the duration of the recording. 220
    \item Set the sampling rate. 230
    \item Select data imputation options
    \item Select feature extration options
    \item Select normalization options
    \item Select machine learning model
    \item Record with specified configuration. 240, 250, 260, 290, 300
    \item Overview sensor data whilst recording. 270, 280
    \item Record again with same configuration. 310
    \item Record again with different configuration. 320
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Extending Test Cases}
TBD
\subsection{Test Scenarios}
The test scenarios are composed of the mentioned test cases. Starred test scenarios indicate that the scenario includes extending functionalities.
\subsubsection{Test Scenario 1 - First Time User}
A user who is new to machine learning applications opens the webpage on their computer and registers to the service. After logging in, the user collects data using the default configuration with their phone and trains a machine learning model. The user then deploys this model and uses the deployed models' unique QR code to identify new data they record. 
\newpage
\begin{enumerate}
    \item /T010/ Access web page.
    \item /T020/ Create a new user.
    \item /T030/ Login with existing credentials.
    \item /T060/ Create a new workspace.
    \item /T120/ Scan QR code.
    \item /T270/ Record with specified configuration.
    \item /T290/ Record again with same configuration.
    \item /T190/ Train and deploy a model.
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Test Scenario 2 - Invalid credentials}
User tries to login with invalid credentials first and manages to login after a few unsuccessful attempts.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item /T010/ Access web page.
    \item /T030/ Login with invalid credentials.
    \item /T030/ Login with invalid credentials.
    \item /T030/ Login with existing credentials.
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Test Scenario 3 - Unsupported Desktop Client}
User opens the website on an unsupported desktop browser and is welcomed with an error message.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item 
\end{enumerate} 
\subsubsection{Test Scenario 4 - Unsupported Mobile Client}
User scans the QR code they received to begin recording data. It turns out their device doesn't support the Sensor API and the website notifies the user about it.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item 
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Test Scenario 4 - Forgotten Password}
User tries to login with an invalid username and/or password. After a few attempts user requests a new password using the "Forgot Password" functionality and successfully manages to login using their new password.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item 
\end{enumerate} 
\subsubsection{Test Scenario 5 - Data Deletion} 
User logs in and opens their previously set workspace. User finds some data samples and labels to be improper and deletes them.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item 
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Test Scenario 6 - Interruption during Recording}
User uses the link they was provided previously to start collecting data. After configuring the options the user starts the recording. Whilst recording user receives a phone call. Recording continues during the call. The user then discards the recording and start a new recording. 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item /T010/ Access web page.
    \item /
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Test Scenario 7 - Registration with Already Existing Credentials}
User opens the website on their desktop device and tries to register with an already existing username.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item 
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Test Scenario 8 - Multi-language Support*}
User opens the website and changes the langauge option to German. 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item 
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Test Scenario 9 - Extensive Use of Main Functionalities}
User opens the website and creates a new account. 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item 
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Test Scenario 10 - Extensive Use of All Functionalities*}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item 
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Test Scenario 11 - Brute-force Attempt*}
User with malicious intents tries to hack an account through brute-forcing. After 5 unsuccessful login attempts, they are presented with a CAPTCHA to solve.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item 
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Test Scenario 12 - Multiple/Simultaneous Data Collection and Classification}
