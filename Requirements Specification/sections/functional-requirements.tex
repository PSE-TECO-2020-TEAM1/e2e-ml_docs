\section{Functional Requirements}

\subsection{Main Functions}
These functions must be implemented in order to fulfill the core criteria.

\subsubsection{Web Client}
The web client supports both desktop and mobile modes. The functionality that will be displayed is determined by the device information of the browser.

    \item Display the selected data sample as a graphs (line plot, bar plot, box plot, histogram, distplot, heatmaps, 2D and 3D Scatter plot)
    \item Display the metadata of the selected data sample (identifier of the recording device and recording date/time)
    \item Allow setting the start/end time of the labeled actions on the graph view of the selected data sample
    \item Allow relabeling the selected data sample

    \item Show an error if not all the required sensors are available in the device
    \item Allow configuring the countdown duration until the recording starts
    \item Allow configuring the recording duration
    \item Show a button to initiate the recording
    \item Show a countdown page with the current configuration on display (sensors used, sampling rate and label)
    \item Display the sensor data in real-time as curves for each sensor on a single graph
    \item Show a recording completed page when the recording duration times out
