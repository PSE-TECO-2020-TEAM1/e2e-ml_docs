\section{Functional Requirements}

\subsection{Main Functions}
These functions must be implemented in order to fulfill the core criteria.

\subsubsection{Web Client}
The web client supports both desktop and mobile modes. The functionality that will be displayed is determined by the device information of the browser.

\paragraph{Desktop Web Client}

% improve on this with cross referencing, need to learn latex tho, later

\begin{enumerate}[{label = \textbf{/F{\protect\twodigits{\arabic{enumi}}}0/}, leftmargin = *}]
    \item Show a welcome page
    \item Provide a QR code on the welcome page to create a \gls{workspace}
    \item Show the management panel for a created workspace
    \item Display the collected data on the management panel
    \item Enumerate the collected data chronologically on the management panel
    \item Allow naming of the model on the management panel
    \item Allow creating new labels for the actions to be recorded
    \item Allow selecting the possible actions on the data on the management panel % needs to be more specific % after ml workshop
    \item Request the processing of the data according to the selected options
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Mobile Web Client}
\begin{enumerate}[resume*]
    \item Show a configuration page with available labels
    \item Allow configuring the countdown duration until the recording starts
    \item Allow configuring the recording duration
    \item \textbf{Allow selecting the amount of data samples to be recorded ????} %???
    \item Allow configuring each sensor individually
    \item Show a button to initiate the recording
    \item Show a countdown page
    \item Display the configuration on the countdown page
    \item Show a recording page
    \item Display the sensor data in real-time as curve graphs
    \item Show a recording completed page % details in a later mockup?
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Server API}
\begin{enumerate}[resume*]
    \item Generate and serve a link for a new workspace
    \item Serve workspace information
    \item Accept data from the mobile client
    \item Create a model in the workspace
    \item Rename a model
    \item Initiate the configured model training
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Data Processing}
\begin{enumerate}[resume*]
    \item \textbf{TBD, after workshop}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Extending Functions}
\begin{enumerate}[resume*]
    \item Show the previously visited workspaces on the welcome page
    \item Make the workspace link password protected
    \item Delete an existing model in the workspace (Server API)
    \item Create a read-only link for classifying (Server API)
    \item \textbf{should the desktop client show data being collected in real time?}
\end{enumerate}
