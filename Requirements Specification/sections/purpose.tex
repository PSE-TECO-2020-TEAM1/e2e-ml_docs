\subsection{Core criteria}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The web pages are the graphical user interfaces (GUI) for users.
    \item The desktop client presents a QR code that when scanned by a mobile client connects it to the same \gls{workspace}.
    \item The QR code contains the link to the \gls{workspace} and the same link can be used to reaccess the workspace later.
    \item The desktop client allows management features.
    \item The mobile web client allows input of new data points in form of raw sensor data.
    \item The mobile web client allows for selecting the sensors the users wish to use. (e.g accelerometer)
    \item The mobile web client allows for labeling the recorded data.
    \item The mobile web client gives a real time feedback of sensor data to the user.
    \item The mobile web client sends the collected sensor data to the web server.
    \item The desktop web client displays the collected samples.
    \item The desktop web client allows preprocessing and filtering of the data.
    \item The features which were selected by the user are computed and stored in the database.
    \item The sent sensor data is stored in the central database in a unified format.
    \item Users can select a machine learning model they wish to use.
    \item Users can change the hyperparameters of the machine learning model.
    \item A model is trained and stored in the database.
    \item The link to the workspace with the trained model can be used to identify the sensor data on the mobile web client. The identification happens in real time.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Optional criteria}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Links for previously accessed workspaces can be stored on the browser to ease reaccess.
    \item Other data capturing devices are supported, e.g. Arduino.
    \item The workspaces can be protected with a password.
    \item The desktop web client displays a status sign if a data collecting device is currently connected to the workspace, e.g. a green sign if connected and a red sign otherwise.
    \item The mobile web client can define triggers if something is detected, e.g. play a sound.
    \item The desktop web client can show performance metrics to the user. (OPTIONAL ?)
    \item The user can train multiple models from the same data sample.
    \item A read-only link to each trained model in a workspace can be generated by the user.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Exclusion criteria}
\begin{itemize}
    \item TBD
    \item Auth (I honestly think it's outside of the scope of PSE, there are dozens of auth providers and every company already has it's own auth system in place (Shibboleth etc.) and we can't possibly support them all)
    \item --> any sort of security
\end{itemize}
