\subsection{Core criteria}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The desktop client presents a QR code that when scanned by a mobile client connects it to the same \gls{workspace}.
    \item The workspace provides a link to reaccess the workspace. 
    \item The web pages are the graphical user interfaces (GUI) for users.
    \item The desktop client allows management features.
    \item The mobile web client allows input of new data points in form of raw sensor data.
    \item The mobile web client allows for selecting the sensors the users wish to use. (e.g accelerometer)
    \item The mobile web client allows for labeling the recorded data.
    \item The mobile web client gives a real time feedback of sensor data to the user.
    \item The mobile web client sends the collected sensor data to the web server.
    \item The desktop web client displays the collected samples.
    \item The desktop web client allows preprocessing and filtering of the data.
    \item The features which were selected by the user are computed and stored in the database.
    \item The sent sensor data is stored in the central database in a unified format.
    \item Users can select a machine learning model they wish to use.
    \item Users can change the hyperparameters of the machine learning model.
    \item A model is trained and stored in the database.
    \item The mobile web client identifies the trained model in real time.
\end{itemize}
    
\subsection{Optional criteria}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Links for previously accessed workspaces can be stored on the browser to ease reaccess.
    \item Other data capturing devices are supported, e.g. Arduino.
    \item The workspaces can be protected with a password.
    \item The mobile web client can define triggers if something is detected, e.g. play a sound.
    \item The desktop web client can show performance metrics to the user. (OPTIONAL ?)
    \item Access Control through read-only links
    \item The user can train multiple models from the same data model.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Exclusion criteria}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Auth (I honestly think it's outside of the scope of PSE, there are dozens of auth providers and every company already has it's own auth system in place (Shibboleth etc.) and we can't possibly support them all)
    \item --> any sort of security
\end{itemize}
