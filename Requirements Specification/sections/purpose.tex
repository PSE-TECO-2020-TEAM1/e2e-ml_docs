\section{Purpose}

\subsection{Web Client}
\subsubsection{Core criteria}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The web page is the graphical user interface (GUI) for users and administrators.
    \item Seperate web pages should be displayed on desktop and mobile devices. % (Can be more specific)
    \item The desktop client presents a QR code that when scanned creates a new workspace and connects the mobile client to
          this workspace.
    \item The workspace serves a link to reaccess it.
    \item The mobile web client allows for selecting the sensors the users wish to use.
    \item The mobile web client allows for labeling the recorded data.
    \item The mobile web client gives a real time feedback of sensor data to the user.
    \item The mobile web client sends the collected sensor data to the web server.
    \item The desktop web client displays the collected samples and allows preprocessing and filtering.
    \item The mobile web client identifies the trained model in real time.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Optional criteria}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Other data capturing devices are supported, e.g. Arduino.
    \item The workspaces can be protected with a password.
    \item The mobile web client can define triggers if something is detected, e.g. play a sound.
    \item The desktop web client can show performance metrics to the user.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Exclusion criteria}
\begin{itemize}
    \item 
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Backend \emph{(change to Data Processing maybe?)}}
\subsubsection{Core criteria}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The sent sensor data is stored in the central database in a unified format.
    \item A selection of machine learning models are offered.
    \item A model is trained and stored in the database.
    \item The features which were selected by the user are computed and stored in the database.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Optional criteria}
\begin{itemize}
    \item TBD
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Exclusion criteria}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Auth (I honestly think it's outside of the scope of PSE, there are dozens of auth providers and every company already has it's own auth system in place (Shibboleth etc.) and we can't possibly support them all)
    \item Access Control (Same reasoning as above)
    \item --> any sort of security
\end{itemize}
