\section{Product Overview}

 {\pseProjectName} is a web-tool that enables its users to create, edit and manage machine learning models on different sensor data. The web-tool consists of two primary components:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item A server application that handles the API calls. Main functions of the server are handling the feature extraction, feature preprocessing, model training and managing the database.
    \item Desktop and mobile client applications to manage and interact with the models, e.g. adding new data samples, identifying given data samples and setting parameters for model training. A model can be utilized on different clients at the same time. Clients have different capabilites depending on the platform, mobile clients allow input of new data samples in form of raw sensor data, while desktop clients allow management features.
\end{enumerate}

Both components together allow for a streamlined and easy-to-use machine learning experience for both the unexperienced and the expert.
