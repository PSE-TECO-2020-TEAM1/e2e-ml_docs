\section{Product Overview}

 {\pseProjectName} is a web-tool that enables its users to create, edit and manage machine learning models on different sensor data. The web-tool consists of three primary components:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Desktop Web Client Application}
    The desktop web client application lets the clients manage their data and train/deploy models. Managing the data set includes creating seperate workspaces, configuring sensors, creating new labels for the data and labeling the individual samples on an interactive graph.

    \item \textbf{Mobile Application Client Application}
    The mobile web client application lets the clients add new data samples or classify actions via the sensors of their devices. For the data recording, the clients can choose a label for the recording, set a countdown to recording duration and set the recording duration. For the classifying of the actions, the clients perform an action and the classification happens in real time.

    \item \textbf{Server Application}
    The server application makes services available via a REST API. Main functions of the server are handling the feature preprocessing, feature extraction, model deployment, model training, data storage and serving the web clients.
\end{enumerate}

Both components together allow for a streamlined and easy-to-use machine learning experience for the unexperienced and the expert.
