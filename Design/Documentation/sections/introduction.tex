\section{Introduction}
The purpose of this documentation is to inform the reader about the design of our project. For this purpose readers are presented with class and sequence diagrams. Class diagrams show the general hierarchy and relation between the classes. Seqeunce diagrams are used to provide the reader an intuition about how different classes interact with each other during runtime of the software.
