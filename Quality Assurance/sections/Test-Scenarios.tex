\section{Test Scenarios}
The following test scenarios are the one handled in the specification requirements document. Starred test scenarios indicate that extending functionalities are also tested in the scenario.
\subsubsection{Test Scenario 1 - First Time User}
A user opens the webpage on their computer and registers to the service. After logging in, the user creates a new workspace. The user adds a new label to this workspace and initiates data collection via scanning the QR code. On their mobile device they choose a label for the action they will record. The user then starts recording using the default configuration. After the recording concludes, the user starts another recording. With the data they have collected, the user trains and deploys a machine learning machine learning model{model}. The user then scans the deployed machine learning model models' unique QR code to identify new data they record in real-time. Lastly, the user stops the classification and examines the classified actions.

\subsubsection{Test Scenario 12 - Multiple/Simultaneous Data Collection and
Classification}
Two mobile clients (A and B) collect data for one workspace simultaneously. Client A
uses the link to initiate data collection, while client B scans the QR code. They both
choose a label for their recording. Client A sets the recording countdown and duration,
whereas client B start recording directly using the default configuration. While client
A is recording their first data, client B starts another recording. After their recordings
conclude, client A uses the link to initiate classification, while client B scans the QR link.
They concurrently classify the data they record.
