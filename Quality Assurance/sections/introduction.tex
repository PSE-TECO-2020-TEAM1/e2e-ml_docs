\section{Introduction}
The purpose of this document is to inform the reader about the quality assurance phase of our project. Through this steps we will assure that the code written in the Implementation phase is reliable and the software is easy to use and has a high performance:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Testing basic actions the user can take, by simulating all test scenarios mentioned in the Requirements Specification Document 
    \item Checking what percentage of the code is test covered by line coverage, function coverage and statement coverage
    \item Usability testing using the Think-Aloud Method to show how users interact with the software
\end{itemize}
