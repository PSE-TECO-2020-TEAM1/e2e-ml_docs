\section{Introduction}
The purpose of this documentation is to inform the reader about the quality assurance phase of our project. Through this steps we will assure that the code written in the Implementation phase is reliable and the software is easy to use and has a high performance:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Testing basic action user can take, by proceeding all test scenarios handled in the Requirements specification Document. 
    \item Checking how much of the code is test covered by line coverage, Function coverage and statement coverage testing
    \item Usability testing using the Thinkaloud Method to show how users interact with the software.
\end{itemize}
