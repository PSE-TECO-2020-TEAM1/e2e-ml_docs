## Recommended build environment on Windows systems

- Download ubuntu WSL from Microsoft Store.
- `sudo apt install texlive-full` (if you are low on disk space, then `sudo apt install texlive-latex-recommended`, this one's much smaller)
- `sudo apt install latexmk`
- Install `LaTeX Workshop` vscode extension (you may need to install it twice to both WSL and Windows)
